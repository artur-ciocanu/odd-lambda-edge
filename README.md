# Background
This repository tries to demonstrate how we can leverage `Adobe Target NodeJS SDK` with On-Device Dcisioning from `AWS Lambda@Edge`.

The repository contains two folders:
- `function` - here we have all the code required by `AWS Lambda function`
- `terraform` - here we have all the `Terraform` code that bootstraps all necessary resources to be able to use `Adobe Target NodeJS SDK` from `AWS Lambda@Edge`.
